    <ul>
      <li>A Typescript / Angular app.</li>
      <li>You can input timing data and compute results locally.</li>
      <li>
        Since you own the data you could get a license, host the app on your site, and serve results
        to at least all the entries in a race.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Getting Started</h4>

    <p>I recommend that you try out the following steps, it should work:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Click Reset button, it will load the default test event and show the race table below the
        input area.
      </li>
      <li>The test event has two races and one intermediate time point.</li>
      <li>
    Navigate through the races with R- and R+ buttons, and through the time points with IT- and IT+
      </li>
      <li>Note that there is a time point called IT0, which is the finish of the race.</li>
      <li>
    Click Next button, it will take you back to Race 1 - IT 1, the first mark rounding in the race.
      </li>
      <li>
    Because button Next has figured out where we are in the progress of the race - at the beginning.
      </li>
      <li>Notice how the current race and current IT are displayed as part of the input header line.</li>
      <li>Click on the circular fab buttons (floating action buttons).</li>
      <li>At least once: select the dnf radio button before you click.</li>
      <li>Notice how the radio selection will jump back to time when you click a fab.</li>
      <li>The fab just clicked will turn blue.</li>
      <li>Click Next again when all fabs have been used up.</li>
      <li>You will be advanced to the finish time point of race 1, please check.</li>
      <li>Click Rows and Event to show the event table in addition to the race table.</li>
      <li>Continue with the fabs and this time watch both tables.</li>
      <li>Play with the toolbar icon buttons, most of them have the Reduce To action type.</li>
      <li>
        Some of the buttons will toggle, some will show, hide, or have an action type of Reduce To.
      </li>
      <li>Go ahead and input timing info for Race 2.</li>
      <li>You can skip IT1 and only do the finish.</li>
      <li>There are only two races in this test event.</li>
      <li>When done, examine that series scoring is correct in table event.</li>
      <li>Adjust the number of throwouts with button T+ and T-.</li>
      <li>Note that you can sort the html table with a click on the column header.</li>
      <li>Find the Pre-Text area and use it to copy result data in compact format to the clipboard.</li>
      <li>Try and paste the text data you just copied into your favorite code editor program.</li>
      <li>
        I assume that you test in Chrome on the desktop before you use it on a tablet or even a
        phone.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You need to input a finish position or a status value for all the entries in a race.</p>

    <p>I will go through some terms quickly.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A regatta has events.</li>
      <li>An event has races.</li>
      <li>A race has time points.</li>
      <li>At minimum, there is the finish time point.</li>
      <li>You may set up some intermediate time points.</li>
      <li>Remember that IT0 is the finish time point.</li>
      <li>IT1 is the first time point and so on.</li>
      <li>You need to do the finish; all other time points are optional.</li>
      <li>The entries in a race are called bibs, corresponding to bows or bow numbers.</li>
      <li>By tapping on fabs you finish off bibs until done.</li>
      <li>You can assign a status value like dnf to a bib instead of a time.</li>
      <li>You can also erase the time for the current bib or reset the status to ok.</li>
      <li>A bib with a status other than ok will not have a fab on the next IT.</li>
      <li>
        A bib with a finish position other than 0 for the race in the event will also be excluded.
      </li>
    </ul>
